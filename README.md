## Problem Description
Pair of employees who have worked together

Create an application that identifies the pair of employees who have worked
together on common projects for the longest period of time.

Input data:
A CSV file with data in the following format:

EmpID, ProjectID, DateFrom, DateTo

Sample data:
143, 12, 2013-11-01, 2014-01-05
218, 10, 2012-05-16, NULL
143, 10, 2009-01-01, 2011-04-27
...

Sample output:
143, 218, 8

Specific requirements
1) DateTo can be NULL, equivalent to today
2) The input data must be loaded to the program from a CSV file
3) The task solution needs to be uploaded in github.com, repository name must be in format:
   {FirstName}-{LastName}-employees

Bonus points

1) Create an UI:
   The user picks up a file from the file system and, after selecting it, all common projects of the
   pair are displayed in datagrid with the following columns:
   Employee ID #1, Employee ID #2, Project ID, Days worked

2) More than one date format to be supported, extra points will be given if all date formats are
   supported
